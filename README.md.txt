Justification

1. I used Spring Boot as it makes it easier to test web application as it has embedded http servers, like Tomcat.

2. Spring Boot also offered simpler dependency management to the starter projects compared to CRUD web application.

3. Spring Boot allowed the ability to create stand-alone Spring applicaitons.

4. I also used Mockito test my application as it allowed to me to mock out classes and interfaces.
